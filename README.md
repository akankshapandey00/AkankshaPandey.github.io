## **🔬 Research & Work Experience**  

### **Biotherapeutic Engineering Co-op**  
📍 *Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Cambridge, MA* (Jan 2024 - June 2024)  
- Engineered NGS pipelines in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment for large-scale antibody sequence
analysis (~3 million reads), applying Python and R for data processing and QC.  
- Performed structure-activity analyses using MOE/PyMOL, refining hits based on binding affinity and leading to faster
experimental validation cycles 
- Automated **liability predictions**, reducing analysis time by 30%.  
- Designed antibodies using **homology modeling** and **structural optimization**.  
- Collaborated on a manuscript submission after analyzing 3 million antibody sequences, identifying key developability
trends and patterns.  

### **Research Intern**  
📍 *BioLim Centre for Science and Technology, India* (Nov 2021 - Dec 2021)  
- Conducted research on novel drug delivery systems for targeted cancer therapy.  
- Explored **affordable early cancer detection** methods.
